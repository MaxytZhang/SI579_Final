## Intuition
Crypto currencies have been a hot topic as their values explode. Apart from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), there are various crypto currencies traded among different exchanges. While it's the common practice to trade one crypto currency with another, e.g. ETH-BTC, the ratio between two crypto currencies differs exchange by exchange. So it's totally possible for buy with a lower ratio from one exchange and then sell with a higher ratio to another exchange and thus benefiting from it.
